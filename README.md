# READMEGenerator

## Description 
The Motivation for this project was to make an application that would streamline the process of writing a README. The code solves the problems of having to format your own README. It takes in all the information that you need and then outputs a clean and professional-looking README.  through this project I learned how to use the Inquirer Package in depth.

First, you have to set up npm and the inquirer package.

This will bring you multiple questions you will have to answer. Answer the Questions to the best of your abilities. After you are finished answering the questions, you will find your Brand New README  in the createdReadMe Folder.

## Collaborators
I would like to thank the creator of the inquirer package, without who's code, i could not make this README generator. I would alo like to thank mozilla for their extensive documentation on JavaScript.
